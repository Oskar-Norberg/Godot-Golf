Godot-Golf is a Mini-Golf game made using the Godot Engine. This is my very first large scale game project and it is made with the intention of learning the basics of game development, gameplay programming and Godot as a whole. The game supports both singleplayer and multiplayer through the use of peer to peer networking. 

### Port forwarding
To play online the host must port forward the port 1984. This depends on router and isp, search up tutorials for your exact router.
