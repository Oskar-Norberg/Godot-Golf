Godot-Golf is a Mini-Golf game made using the Godot Engine. This is the very first large scale game project I have ever made and it is made with the intention of learning GDscript, Godot and game-engine basics to allow for further studies in the subject. The game currently supports both Singleplayer and Multiplayer by the use of peer to peer networking. No official release build has yet been offered as the game is in early stages of development.
